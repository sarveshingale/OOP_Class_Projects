# OOP_Class_Projects Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the `OOP_Class_Projects` repository! This collection features a variety of projects that demonstrate my journey through learning and applying Java and C++ concepts. From simple canonical programs to complex multithreaded applications, this repository showcases my skills in object-oriented programming. Below are descriptions of each project included in this repository.

## Projects

### P01 - Canonical Java Program
A simple Java program where I:
- Printed a name.
- Acquired a name from the user.
- Printed the acquired name.
- Guessed the name using local variables.

### P02 - Line Simulation with RGB Colors
Developed a Java class to simulate lines:
- Stored line colors using RGB values.
- Displayed the colored lines in the terminal.

### P03 to P06 - Library Management System (LMS)
Focused on OOP principles in Java with multithreading for efficiency:
- Managed a library system with features like book borrowing and returning.
- Implemented classes for books, users, and library operations.
- For a more detailed description, see the separate repository `LMS_OOP`.

### P07 - Multithreaded Word Puzzle Solver
Created a Java program to solve word puzzles using multithreading:
- Analyzed performance using different numbers of threads.
- Optimized the baseline algorithm for better performance.

### P08 - Canonical C++ Program
A basic C++ program that:
- Demonstrated basic input/output operations.
- Used `std::vector` for data handling.

### P09 - Shape Modeling in C++
Developed a class hierarchy to model shapes:
- Focused on inheritance and polymorphism.
- Utilized pure virtual functions to define behavior for different shapes.

### P10 - Time Class with Operator Overloading
Created a `Time` class in C++:
- Implemented operator overloading for various operations.
- Supported essential time manipulation features.

### P11 - Index Maker Utility
Developed a utility in C++ to create an index of words from text files:
- Read multiple text files and indexed all words.
- Stored file names and line numbers for each word using maps, sets, and iterators.

### P12 - Mini-Programs Collection
A collection of small C++ programs demonstrating:
- Use of threads.
- Application of templates.
- File I/O operations.
- Utilization of iterators.
